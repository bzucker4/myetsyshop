"Orgone Rose Quartz Pyramid, Guardian Angel and Tumbled Stones Orgonite, Energy Generator for Protection, Reiki, Home Decor","65mm Orgone Rose Quartz & Quartz Point pyramid


These 2"" Orgonite Pyramids are well made and so purposeful.

Use this pyramid to harness the power of unconditional love towards yourself or your environment. The pyramids were used as powerful healing chambers.

Filled with the essential ingredients to activate the orgone. Complete with a copper wrapped quartz point at the top. Bottom base measures almost 3"" x 3"" and stands approximately 2"".

Electrical pollution, sometimes referred to as dirty electricity, is a way to describe what people are being exposed to constantly in our modern, high-tech society.

It is not detected by any of our senses, so it is a largely unknown phenomenon.

Dirty electricity is unusable electromagnetic energy (also referred to as “EMFs”) that permeates from the many electric devices that surround us.

Negative and toxic energy move through the Orgonite pyramids, creating electromagnetic friction resulting from the mixture of metal and crystal in the resin.

Orgonite pyramids do not eliminate the electromagnetic energy; instead, they reorganize the pattern of the energy to one that is harmonized for the human body.

Think of an orgonite pyramid like a filter for toxic energy in your surroundings.

While orgonite can be made into many shapes, the pyramid is a popular form because pyramids are renowned for their ability to amplify and transmit energy.

Crafting orgonite into a pyramid shape is an easy way to enhance its positive effects.

Orgone pyramids are made of a mix of organic (resin) and non-organic materials (metal shavings) that have the property of moving the orgone energy back and forth and act as a cleansing of the stagnant, negative energies.

Hence, the powerful healing effects of the crystals are magnified in an orgone pyramid.",26.95,USD,3,"orgonite_pyramid,orgone_pyramid,emf_protection,orgone,organite,crystal_pyramid,pyramid,energy_generator,orgone_generator,energy_healing,meditation_tool,pyramid_jewels,orgonite_mwo",,https://i.etsystatic.com/36888730/r/il/d5f312/4095161743/il_fullxfull.4095161743_43lh.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/36888730/r/il/fd82cb/4047506412/il_fullxfull.4047506412_1a0h.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"White Sage Animal Tarot Deck by Theresa Hutch: Minimalist Art Cards","Inspired by ancient healing traditions this charming tarot deck features endearing animals in the Court Cards, chakra colors in the Minors, and natural elements throughout. The 78 cards balance masculine and feminine energy with modern minimalist art rendered in a soft pastel palette. White Sage Tarot helps people find clarity and flow along the journey of life. Includes 78 pocket-sized cards in a tin, 64-page booklet and chakra chart. Theresa Hutch, artist and creator of White Sage Tarot has worked as a graphic designer, art teacher, yoga teacher, and illustrator.

Seeking a way to balance the masculine energy in our culture with a soft, strong and feminine deck, White Sage Tarot was born. The white sage plant is often used in smudging, particularly as an ancient Native American method to cleanse spaces and people. The intention of White Sage Tarot is to help people find clarity and flow while navigating life's journey.

White Sage Tarot is a modern, minimalist 78-card deck based on a classical model of tarot. The animals wear clothing, creating a whimsical touch to both the Court Cards and the Major Arcana. The colors of the seven chakras (energy centers) are incorporated into the Minor Arcana Cards as an additional way to read the deck.

""The White Sage Tarot is a really beautiful & creative tarot deck. The author uses very soft pastel colors on the characters, however, when using this deck, you're also working with the colors that represent the energy chakra system which I thought was really creative. For example, the three of swords is covered in blue ribbons which represent the throat chakra color. The deck also comes with a cheat sheet explaining the 7 chakra energy centers.. The images primarily are of animals, they are regal, whimsical and simply adorable. It is a soft 'clean' deck. If your not comfortable working with darker decks and want to work with a deck that is more lighter in nature and even child friendly. I am very happy with it.""

—Norie

""This deck is so soothing, with its pastels, animals, and gentle nature imagery. The wands are p. willows, the pentacles are sand dollars, and there is not a human to be seen. A few of the majors have an Egyptian flair. The imagery in this deck is probably one of the least threatening I’ve ever seen. For example, Death is just a light at the end of a tunnel. I believe people new to tarot should learn on a Rider-Waite to be able to use the traditional imagery to understand each card, but if you are already comfortable this is a sweet and fun deck to add to your collection. It’s become the one I reach for most! The size and tin make them a perfect deck for a purse, bag, or night out at the bar. They are an absolute joy to shuffle, just the right flexibility and texture. Enjoy!

INSTANT DOWNLOAD | Complete eBook in PDF Format

The Problem:

Supermassive black holes exist in galaxies less than 700 million years after the Big Bang. According to the laws of physics and the timeline of the universe, this is impossible. There hasn't been enough time for them to grow this large through normal processes.

The Solution:

Black hole stars, objects that could only exist in the early universe when conditions allowed stars to violate every normal limit on stellar growth. They grew to millions of solar masses, survived their own deaths with black holes at their cores, and created the massive ""seeds"" needed to explain supermassive black holes.

What This Book Covers:

- How normal stars form and why radiation pressure limits their maximum size
- The unique physics of the early universe that made black hole stars possible
- The formation process: from primordial gas clouds to runaway stellar growth
- Core collapse while the star still lives—the contained supernova
- Black hole-powered accretion at impossible scales
- The violent million-year life of a star consuming itself from within
- How massive seed black holes solve the timeline problem
- Current JWST observations that may confirm their existence

Technical Topics Explained:

✓ Stellar formation and fusion ignition
✓ The Eddington limit and radiation pressure
✓ Dark matter halos as gravitational scaffolding
✓ Super-Eddington accretion physics
✓ Accretion disc dynamics and magnetic jet formation
✓ Black hole growth rates and mass constraints
✓ Early universe cosmology and observational evidence

Written For:

- Readers who want scientific depth without oversimplification
- Space and astronomy enthusiasts
- Anyone interested in black holes and extreme physics
- Those following JWST discoveries
- Students and educators in physics and astronomy

"The Neural Harvest: Surviving the Simulation | Escape The Matrix | Frequency Warfare | Spiritual Awakening Truth Book","They didn't just hijack your food. They hijacked your frequency.
This is not another conspiracy theory book. This is not gentle spiritual guidance. This is a surgical transmission designed to tear the blindfold off your face and force you to see the architecture of your imprisonment.

You have been living inside a simulation. Your history is fabricated. Your food is weaponized. Your water calcifies the one organ that connects you to higher consciousness. The satellites above your head aren't just for the internet; they're building a neural control grid around the entire planet. And the people you pass every day? Many of them are biological machines with no sovereign soul, placed here specifically to drain your energy and keep you compliant.
Every chapter is designed to activate, not inform. Every page is a frequency warfare against the systems that feed on your fear.

You will feel resistance. Your programming will tell you to stop reading. That resistance is not yours; it's the matrix defending itself through you.
The age of comfort is over. The illusion is collapsing. The cracks are showing. And you are being called to remember who you were before they taught you to forget.

This book will not save you. But it will show you exactly how you've been caged, who built the cage, and the one weapon they fear most: your sovereign frequency operating at a level they cannot touch.

If you're looking for hope, platitudes, or gradual awakening, this is not your book.
If you're ready to see the truth that shatters everything, read on.

Are you a beginner in the Tarot? I designed this deck just for you! When I first started reading, I was always having to consult resources and books even for the simplest level of understanding and reference. I wished then for a deck that contained keywords for upright AND reversed, major themes, elemental correspondences, and numerology right on the card. How great would that be? So I DESIGNED it. And I'm now sharing my dream deck with you!

With this beginner tarot deck, you can easily begin to familiarize yourself with the main themes contained in each card, how they fit into the zodiac, what elements they correspond to, and what their numerological significance is. Even if you're an intermediate or advanced reader, having such an on-card guide will help you deepen your knowledge and provide a guide to further study or reference in your spiritual practice. Each card has:

- Main THEME of each card as a quote to get you going in your personal interpretation
- KEYWORDS for both upright AND reversed in their proper orientation
- ELEMENT correspondence with symbols for earth, air, fire, and water
- ASTROLOGICAL correspondence with symbols for planets and zodiac symbols
- NUMEROLOGICAL correspondence and meaning

"Vintage Astrology Book by Sepharial: Make & Read Your Horoscope (PDF Download)","ASTROLOGY: HOW TO MAKE AND READ YOUR OWN HOROSCOPE By SEPHARIAL--PDF FORMAT-- DIGITAL DOWNLOAD ONLY

The practical uses of Astrology are daily more and more recognized and appreciated, and although some of the higher and later developments of Astrology in its relation to every-day problems have necessarily been withheld from these pages, yet it is to be hoped that so much as is here presented of an abstruse and recondite science will enable the student to pursue the subject with increasing assurance and satisfaction, in which case doubtless he will readily discover for himself, and without any special pointing on my part, that Astrology is primarily and finally a practical and useful study.

When we have thoroughly arrived at an understanding of the complex nature of human character and the primary causes of variety in expression, when we have seen for ourselves how the many-colored dome of Life overarches us of this sublunary world with its kaleidoscopic interplay of forces, we shall be to some extent better equipped not only to deal with character as we find it, but also to direct the forces of the human mind along channels which lead to the preservation of our social economy, and that not by any restrictive measures or harmful suppression of natural passions and powers, but by conversion of them into forms that are conservative and useful.

To apply oneself to the specialization of inherent faculty, to find the line of least resistance, and to discover the measure of one’s own soul in the universe and the limit to which ambition can safely aspire, these are things necessary to be known and things that Astrology makes clear to the mind in the very earliest stages of our study.

And apart from the scientific verities to which the science of planetary influence directs us, there are other not less important and fascinating truths of a purely philosophic nature to which it inevitably impels the mind and which cannot fail to exercise a tremendous influence in the shaping of our thought in regard to the purpose of life. It places the thoughtful student in an entirely new position with regard to many of the deeper problems of existence, and it is certainly the fact that to those who newly come to its study, Astrology is a revelation, an enlightenment, and a conviction from which there is no possible or desirable escape.

A Book of Shadows is a book containing religious text and instructions for magical rituals found within the Neopagan religion of Wicca. Since its conception in the 1970s, it has made its way into many pagan practices and paths. The most famous Book of Shadows was created by the pioneering Wiccan Gerald Gardner sometime in the late 1940s or early 1950s, and which he utilized first in his Bricket Wood coven and then in other covens which he founded in following decades.

The Book of Shadows is also used by other Wiccan traditions, such as Alexandrian Wicca and Mohsianism, and with the rise of books teaching people how to begin following non-initiatory Wicca in the 1970s onward, the idea of the Book of Shadows was then further propagated amongst solitary practitioners unconnected to earlier, initiatory traditions.",4.99,USD,5,"book_of_shadows,shadow_work,witch_book,wicca_book,wiccan_book,book_of_shadow,book_on_magick,bible_of_spells,witchcraft_spells,book_of_spells,witches_bible,shadow_workbook,shadows_book","Book of shadows,shadow work,Wiccan,Pagan,witchcraft bible",https://i.etsystatic.com/36888730/r/il/bf4038/4371022621/il_fullxfull.4371022621_hge5.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/36888730/r/il/035c6b/4324708066/il_fullxfull.4324708066_c648.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/36888730/r/il/3fd244/4324715246/il_fullxfull.4324715246_5isx.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/36888730/r/il/ff7bfe/4372110627/il_fullxfull.4372110627_jvcb.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/36888730/r/il/a95931/4324717310/il_fullxfull.4324717310_l9zj.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/36888730/r/il/8f17ad/4324717408/il_fullxfull.4324717408_mdrv.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/36888730/r/il/2e20c9/4372111107/il_fullxfull.4372111107_iqed.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/36888730/r/il/c96b14/4324717246/il_fullxfull.4324717246_84be.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/36888730/r/il/13b73d/4372111169/il_fullxfull.4372111169_kac9.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/36888730/r/il/833af2/4372111933/il_fullxfull.4372111933_pru5.jpg,,,,,,,

"Ancient Lessons eBook | Stillness, Presence & Release (PDF Guide)","""Ancient Lessons: Principles of Stillness, Presence, and Release,"" provides a comprehensive guide to timeless wisdom for modern living. It introduces seven core principles, starting with ""The Wisdom of Letting Go,"" which uses the analogy of a tree shedding its leaves to illustrate how clinging leads to suffering and release brings liberation.

Subsequent chapters explore the transformative power of stillness, advocating for quieting mental noise and choosing intentional non-action, and detail the practice of presence or mindfulness by treating ordinary activities as sacred. The book also redefines strength through flexibility, using bamboo and water as examples of resilience, and discusses inner transformation by examining how wounds and suffering can act as doorways to clarity.

Finally, it provides a framework for constructing a value system rooted in internal wealth over material possession and shows the convergence of these truths across various ancient wisdom traditions like Stoicism, Taoism, and Sufism.

"Forest Fae Oracle Cards: Enchanting Fairy Inspiration Deck","Enter the forest, seek wonder and enchantment, and hear the curious messages of the forest fae. This set of 40 magickal cards invites you to delight in your imagination and sparks joy and inspiration. When you’re feeling weighed down by the mundane, these cards will help you to find a gate in the hedge or a way over the wall, to go beyond the boundary between this world and that―to escape your way into the forest and to magick.

Nadia Turner is an Australian Illustrator and Artist who creates wayward wonders out of a little studio up in the Dandenong Ranges just outside of Melbourne, Australia. She works in several mediums, including acrylic on wood and canvas, ink and watercolor, paper and textile collage. Her influences stream from many areas, from the art of the surrealists, especially that of Remedios Varo and Leonora Carrington, the Pre-Raphaelites, traditional folk art, various children's books and of course, ancient myth, symbolism and legends.

I would describe the illustrations as enchanting and the deck’s little messages as encouraging and fun to read. The images on the cards are of various Fae and Fae-like creatures often sporting horns, antlers, or wings, carrying walking sticks or wearing crowns and beads, and often accompanied by birds, bunnies, or other “pet-like” friends.

One of my favorite cards in this deck is titled Strange Journeys, and its message says, “Take control of your quest; choose your companions wisely.”

This card shows a delightful illustration of a small group of characters including a very large furry creature with a human-like face who is wearing beaded necklaces and has horns decorated with hanging beads, a feminine looking person with long hair and branches with leaves that seem to be growing out of her head while she holds a bird, an owl who sits atop the large furry creature and a blue cat wearing a bell at its neck. 

The card titled The Gatekeeper encourages us to “Let go. All things are possible on the borderlands,” while it features a furry creature with tall, pointed wolf-like ears, wearing a feathered cape and holding a walking stick adorned with a crescent moon and three hanging feathers.

The deck is composed of 40 small (4” x 2”) rectangular cards tucked into a beautiful little hinged box. The small size makes the deck easy to shuffle. The cards are good quality card-stock with a glossy finish, and card backs decorated with an image of a crescent moon surrounded by mushrooms in earthy tones of greens and browns.

"The Great Shift | Hidden Truths About The Matrix | Forbidden Knowledge Digital Book: Consciousness Rising & Soul Remembering | Truth Seeker","They don't want you to read this.

An anonymous message attempted to prevent this book from being written. A warning. A threat. The kind that makes you question whether it's worth the risk.

I finished it anyway.

Because some truths can't stay buried. Some things, once you remember them, can't be forgotten. Some knowing lodges itself in your cells, and silence becomes more dangerous than fire.

This isn't another self-help book wrapped in pretty promises.

This is everything the system worked hardest to erase. Drawn from memory. From channeling. 
From lived experience. Not neatly packaged. Not begging for your belief. But radiating with a recognition you'll feel in your body before your mind catches up, that eerie tug behind your ribcage when something here matches what you've always suspected.
Some truths arrive seismic. Others work quietly, subtly, reshaping everything from the inside out.

If you've ever felt like something was off about the official story. If you've sensed there's more to reality than you've been permitted to see. If you've had that nagging feeling that you're remembering something, not learning it for the first time, this book is calling to you.

But understand this: witnesses are never left unchanged.
Once you open these pages, once you see through the layers, once you activate the knowing that's already inside you, you can't go back to sleep. The door doesn't close. The remembering doesn't fade.

You become part of the unraveling.

The question isn't whether you're ready for this book.

The question is: are you ready to stop forgetting?

"White Sage Smudge Spray: Smokeless Cleansing Mist","2oz White Sage smudge spray

Smokeless smudging with this White Sage spray. This hydrosol spray is steam distilled with natural herbs yielding a light fragrance. Release 1-3 sprays into the air to cleanse your personal space and surroundings. 2oz


WHITE SAGE MIST
Drawing upon the ancient practice of white sage smudging for cleansing, ceremonial, and energy clearing work, heal with this smokeless alternative that allows you to energetically cleanse and clear yourself, objects, and spaces of negative energies. Begin by creating a sacred space and making your intentions clear. Mist the white sage spray liberally and chant or recite a prayer or mantra if you wish.

CLEANSE ANYWHERE
Burning a sage wand is not always an option as it could set off smoke alarms, trigger asthmatic symptoms, or it’s not allowed in public spaces. This smudging spray is safe to use to clear away negative energies anytime, anywhere. Use the spray to cleanse your mind and body as well as your home, dormitory, or desk at work. It’s also ideal for cleansing sacred objects or items of sentimental value.

To Use:
This White Sage smokeless Smudging Spray may be used the same as you would any other sage smudge.

This is an alternative to burning sage smudge for people who cannot or are sensitive to the smoke. It is great for traveling and smudging on the go.

Use before meditation, energy work, when you are feeling dragged down, to cleanse a home or space, for grounding, and when the energy feels funky and you need a shift. Also can be used as a crystal cleansing spray.

Shake prior to using. Then spray generously around yourself and your space.

"Beginner Tarot Deck with Keywords: Zodiac, Numerology, Elements","One of the difficulties beginners face in reading Tarot is interpreting the symbolism on each card. For this reason, keywords have been added at the top and bottom (reverse) on each card, to better help the beginner decipher the meanings without constantly referring elsewhere for explanations.🧙‍♀️

Are you a beginner in the Tarot? I designed this deck just for you! When I first started reading, I was always having to consult resources and books even for the simplest level of understanding and reference. I wished then for a deck that contained keywords for upright AND reversed, major themes, elemental correspondences, and numerology right on the card. How great would that be? So I DESIGNED it. And I'm now sharing my dream deck with you!🔮

With this beginner tarot deck, you can easily begin to familiarize yourself with the main themes contained in each card, how they fit into the zodiac, what elements they correspond to, and what their numerological significance is. Even if you're an intermediate or advanced reader, having such an on-card guide will help you deepen your knowledge and provide a guide to further study or reference in your spiritual practice. Each card has: 

- Main THEME of each card as a quote to get you going in your personal interpretation
- KEYWORDS for both upright AND reversed in their proper orientation
- ELEMENT correspondence with symbols for earth, air, fire, and water
- ASTROLOGICAL correspondence with symbols for planets and zodiac symbols
- NUMEROLOGICAL correspondence and meaning



INCLUDES:

• Tarot deck: 78 cards 

• High-quality cards

• Card Size 2.75""X4.75"" (70×120mm)

Review
""Every card interpretation describes the image and explains its meaning. Standard enough, right? But under Graham's spell, the cards become characters in a dark fairy tale, one the reader must negotiate to undergo the transformation each card holds in potential--if we will step up and do the work. This might sound challenging. And, of course, it is. But Graham is kind and wise, a beautiful forest witch who knows that sometimes we must travel the darkest paths to reach the light.""  ~ Jamie Morris Writes

""This is a tarot fairytale rich with symbolism, story, intrigue, and shadowy things."" - Theresa Reed, author of The Tarot Coloring Book.

""If you've ever walked down the aisle of a bookstore and suddenly stopped in your tracks when a cover catches your attention because of its gothic-fairytale, dark-academia-fantasy vibes, then you should have a copy of the Dark Wood Tarot on your shelf. Written by the knowledgeable and experienced Sasha Graham, with art by the incredibly talented Abigail Larson, whether you are a tarot obsessed collector, are asking yourself ""what is tarot?"", or just like pretty fantasy things, I can't recommend this deck enough."" ~ The Nerd Daily

""The Dark Wood tarot deck is unlike any other tarot deck I own (and I own plenty). Its accompanying guidebook details meanings that stray from the traditional Tarot reading that I simply adore. It's unique, and it's the only deck that has managed to really call me out on my bullshit when I needed it to. Could not recommend this deck enough!""  - Refinery 29

""Sasha Graham's masterful storytelling is the perfect backdrop to Abigail Larson's art. Dark Wood Tarot isn't an ordinary Deck - Its an experience."" -The Magickal Earth

""The design of the Dark Wood Tarot is absolutely breathtaking. The cards and booklet are beautifully packaged in a box with a magnetic closure. The back of each card depicts an elegant symmetrical design with the Dark Wood ""DW"" logo in the center, surrounded by gothic scrollwork."" - The Gothic Library 

""The Dark Wood Tarot is well conceived and beautifully illustrated, with undercurrents of black humour, sinister fairy tales, and classic horror."" - Aeclectic Tarot

""The Dark Wood Tarot is is romantic, risqué, and insightful."" - Ask Astrology

"Dreams Box: Fiona Starr Dream Interpretation Cards & Book","Discover why we need to sleep and dream, and how to interpret the meaning of your dreams with this beautifully presented book and deck.

Numerous studies by scientific bodies such as Yale Medicine, the Italian Association of Sleep Medicine, and the University of Cambridge point out that more REM sleep, increased anxiety, decreased sleep quality, and social isolation have affected how much we dream, how many of our dreams we remember (and how vividly), and the nature of our dreams themselves.

The Dreams Box offers insight and wisdom about dream interpretation from both psychological and world traditions. Enclosed in a handy hardcover case for easy-to-use decoding, understanding, and deciphering the unconscious and dreams.

In times of high stress, the dream world can be drastically altered. The Dream Interpretation Box can help you to better understand your changing dreamscape and the effects it has on your mind, body, and spirit.

The guide and dream cards can help you speak with confidence about your experiences and share them with friends and family in the hopes that they, too, can find some comfort and relief knowing what messages their dreams hold for them.

🍄 Mushroom Quotes 🍄

""Out of damp and gloomy days, out of solitude, out of loveless words directed at us, conclusions grow up in us like fungus: one morning they are there, we know not how, and they gaze upon us, morose and gray. Woe to the thinker who is not the gardener but only the soil of the plants that grow in him.""
- Friedrich Nietzsche

""The sudden appearance of mushrooms after a summer rain is one of the more impressive spectacles of the plant world.""
- John Tyler Bonner

""The world is a skyscraper! Don’t always stay on the same floor! Go upstairs, go downstairs; visit the lives of other tenants! Visit eagles, and visit mushrooms!""

How to Read Lenormand? Lenormand Card Meanings

The variety of details Lenormand combinations can communicate makes it somewhat superior to Tarot when asking about the future.

It’s better at answering ‘what’ and ‘where’ questions rather than ‘how’ or ‘why’. While Tarot reading offers a lot of analysis and potential for diving deeper and deeper into the source of things.

For this reason, some esoteric practitioners find Lenormand card reading more intimidating, but don’t forget that divinations tell us merely the likely possibilities with the intention of preparing, advising and guiding us to a better outcome.",61.99,USD,2,"Lenormand,Gothic_Mysteries,Gothic_Oracle,Divination_Cards,Vintage_tarot,fortune_telling_deck,fortune_telling_card,gothic_tarot_deck,gothic_tarot,gold_tarot_deck,gold_tarot_cards,lenormand_tarot,indie_tarot","Indie Tarot Cards,Lenormand Deck,Gold Tarot Cards",https://i.etsystatic.com/36888730/r/il/ffcc35/4685812137/il_fullxfull.4685812137_9vse.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/36888730/r/il/5dc832/4685768759/il_fullxfull.4685768759_748n.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/36888730/r/il/703911/4685812079/il_fullxfull.4685812079_5mgo.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/36888730/r/il/75e261/4637575322/il_fullxfull.4637575322_c706.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/36888730/r/il/f8c577/4685812101/il_fullxfull.4685812101_asr3.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/36888730/r/il/e4309d/4637575326/il_fullxfull.4637575326_nsjm.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/36888730/r/il/b9b14d/4637575328/il_fullxfull.4637575328_deg0.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/36888730/r/il/42f42b/4637575330/il_fullxfull.4637575330_1j7n.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/36888730/r/il/71f6af/4637575332/il_fullxfull.4637575332_2eni.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/36888730/r/il/44761a/4685812145/il_fullxfull.4685812145_2neh.jpg,,,,,,,
